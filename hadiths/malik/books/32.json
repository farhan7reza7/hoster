If they think it is\ntime to wait, they should wait.\"\n\n\nMalik spoke about a man who\ntook qirad money from an investor and used it and when the investor\nasked him for his money, he said that he had it in full. When he held\nhim to his settlement he admitted that \"Such-and-such of it was lost\nwith me,\" and he named an amount of money. \"I told you that so that\nyou would leave it with me.\" Malik said, \"He does not benefit by\ndenying it after he had confirmed that he had it all . He is\nanswerable by his confession against himself unless he produces\nevidence about the loss of that property which confirms his statement.\nIf he does not produce an acceptable reason he is answerable by his\nconfession, and his denial does not avail him.\"\n\n\nMalik said,\n\"Similarly, had he said, 'I have had such-and-such a profit from the\ncapital,' and then the owner of the capital asked him to pay him the\nprincipal and his profit, and he said that he had not had any profit\nin it and had said that only so it might be left in his possession, it\ndoes not benefit him. He is taken to account for what he affirmed\nunless he brings acceptable proof of his word, so that the first\nstatement is not binding on him.\"\n\n\nMalik spoke about an\ninvestor who put qirad money with an agent who made a profit with it.\nThe agent said, \"I took the qirad from you provided that I would have\ntwo-thirds.\" The owner of the capital says, \"I gave you a qirad\nprovided that you had a third.\" Malik said, \"The word is the word of\nthe agent, and he must take an oath on that if what he says resembles\nthe known practice of qirad or is close to it. If he brings a matter\nwhich is unacceptable and people do not make qirads like that, he is\nnot believed, and it is judged to be according to how a qirad like it\nwould normally be.\"\n\n\nMalik spoke about a man who gave a man\none hundred dinars as a qirad. He bought goods with it and then went\nto pay the one hundred dinars to the owner of the goods and found that\nthey had been stolen. The investor says, \"Sell the goods. If there is\nanything over, it is mine. If there is a loss, it is against you\nbecause you lost it.\" The agent says, \"Rather you must fulfil what the\nseller is owed. I bought them with your capital which you gave me.\"\nMalik said, \"The agent is obliged to pay the price to the seller and\nthe investor is told, 'If you wish, pay the hundred dinars to the\nagent and the goods are between you. The qirad is according to what\nthe first hundred was based on. If you wish, you are free of the\ngoods.' If the hundred dinars are paid to the agent, it is a qirad\naccording to the conditions of the first qirad. If he refuses, the\ngoods belong to the agent and he must pay their price.\"\n\n\nMalik\nspoke about two people in a qirad who settled up and the agent still\nhad some of the goods which he used - threadbare cloth or a waterskin\nor the like of that. Malik said, \"Any of that which is insignificant\nis of no importance and belongs to the agent. I have not heard anyone\ngive a decision calling for the return of that. Anything which has a\nprice is returned. If it is something which has value like an animal,\ncamel, coarse cloth or the like of that which fetches a price, I think\nthat he should return what he has remaining of such things unless the\nowner overlooks it.\""},"hadithNumber":1465}],"chapter":{"id":32,"bookId":7,"arabic":"كتاب القراض","english":"Qirad","startHadith":1450,"endHadith":1465,"totalHadiths":16}}
