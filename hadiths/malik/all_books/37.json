His asking permission of his\nheirs is permitted for the heirs, when they give him permission when\nauthority over all his property is closed off from him and nothing\noutside of the third is permitted to him, and when they are more\nentitled to the two-thirds of his property than he is himself. That is\nwhen their permission becomes relevant.
