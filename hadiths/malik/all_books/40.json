The conditions which were confirmed for her are\nconfirmed for them. The death of their mother does not harm them. If\nthe one who made her mudabbara dies, they are free if their value is\nless than one third of his total property.\"\n\n\nMalik said, \"For\nevery mother by birth as opposed to mother by suckling, her children\nare in her position. If she is free and she gives birth after she is\nfree, her children are free. If she is a mudabbara or mukataba, or\nfreed after a number of years in service, or part of her is free or\npledged or she is an umm walad, each of her children are in the same\nposition as their mother. They are set free when she is set free and\nthey are slaves when she is a slave.\"\n\n\nMalik said about the\nmudabbara given a tadbir while she was pregnant, \"Her children are in\nher position. That is also the position of a man who frees his slave-\ngirl while she is pregnant and does not know that she is pregnant.\"\n\n\nMalik said, \"The sunna about such women is that their\nchildren follow them and are set free by their being set free.\"\n\n\nMalik said, \"It is the same as if a man had bought a slave-girl\nwhile she was pregnant. The slave-girl and what is in her womb belong\nto the one who bought her whether or not the buyer stipulates that.\"\n\n\nMalik continued, \"It is not halal for the seller to make an\nexception about what is in her womb because that is an uncertain\ntransaction. It reduces her price and he does not know if that will\nreach him or not. That is as if one sold the foetus in the womb of the\nmother. That is not halal because it is an uncertain transaction .\"\n\n\nMalik said about the mukatab or mudabbar who bought a slave-\ngirl and had intercourse with her and she became pregnant by him and\ngives birth, \"The children of both of them by a slave-girl are in his\nposition. They are set free when he is set free and they are slaves\nwhen he is a slave.\"\n\n\nMalik said, \"When he is set free, the\numm walad is part of his property which is surrendered to him when he\nis set free.\""},"hadithNumber":1607,"hadithId":1},{"id":2,"idInBook":1608,"chapterId":40,"bookId":7,"arabic":"","english":{"narrator":"","text":"Malik spoke about a mudabbar who said to his master, \"Free me\nimmediately and I will give fifty dinars which I will have to pay in\ninstalments.\" His master said, \"Yes. You are free and you must pay\nfifty dinars, and you will pay me ten dinars every year.\" The slave\nwas satisfied with this. Then the master dies one, two or three days\nafter that. He said, \"The freeing is confirmed and the fifty dinars\nbecome a debt against him. His testimony is permitted, his\ninviolability as a free man is confirmed, as are his inheritance and\nhis liability to the full hudud punishments. The death of his master,\nhowever, does not reduce the debt for him at all.\"\n\n\nMalik said\nthat if a man who made his slave a mudabbar died and he had some\nproperty at hand and some absent property, and in the property at hand\nthere was not enough (in the third he was allowed to bequeath) to\ncover the value of the mudabbar, the mudabbar was kept there together\nwith this property, and his tax (kharaj) was gathered until the\nmaster's absent property was clear. Then if a third of what his master\nleft would cover his value, he was freed with his property and what\nhad gathered of his tax. If there was not enough to cover his value in\nwhat his master had left, as much of him was freed as the third would\nallow, and his property was left in his hands."},"hadithNumber":1608,"hadithId":2},{"id":3,"idInBook":1609,"chapterId":40,"bookId":7,"arabic":"","english":{"narrator":"","text":"Malik said, \"The generally agreed-on way of doing things in our\ncommunity is that any setting-free which a man makes in a bequest that\nhe wills in health or illness can be rescinded by him when he likes\nand changed when he likes as long as it is not a tadbir. There is no\nway to rescind a tadbir once he has made it.\n\n\n\"As for every\nchild born to him by a slave-girl who he wills to be set free but he\ndoes not make mudabbara, her children are not freed with her when she\nis freed. That is because her master can change his will when he likes\nand rescind it when he likes, and being set free is not confirmed for\nher. She is in the position of a slave-girl whose master says, 'If so-\nand-so remains with me until I die, she is free.' \" (i.e. he does not\nmake a definite contract.)\n\n\nMalik said, \"If she fulfils that,\nthat is hers. If he wishes, before that, he can sell her and her child\nbecause he has not entered her child into any condition he has made\nfor her.\n\n\n\"The bequest in setting free is different from the\ntadbir. The precedent of the sunna makes a distinction between them.\nHad a bequest been in the position of a tadbir, no testator would be\nable to change his will and what he mentioned in it of setting free.\nHis property would be tied up and he would not be able to use it.\"\n\n\nMalik said about a man who made all his slaves mudabbar while\nhe was well and they were his only property, \"If he made some of them\nmudabbar before the others, one begins with the first until the third\nof his property is reached. (i.e. their value is matched against the\nthird, and those whose value is covered are free.) If he makes the\nmall mudabbar in his illness, and says in one statement, 'So-and-so is\nfree. So-and-so is free. So-and-so is free if my death occurs in this\nillness,' or he makes them all mudabbar in one statement, they are\nmatched against the third and one does not begin with any of them\nbefore the others. It is a bequest and they have a third of his\nproperty divided between them in shares. Then the third of his\nproperty frees each of them according to the extent of his share.\n\n\n\"No single one of them is given preference when that all occurs in\nhis illness.\"\n\n\nMalik spoke about a master who made his slave a\nmudabbar and then he died and the only property he had was the\nmudabbar slave and the slave had property. He said, \"A third of the\nmudabbar is freed and his property remains in his possession.\"\n\n\nMalik said about a mudabbar whose master gave him a kitaba and\nthen the master died and did not leave any property other than him, \"A\nthird of him is freed and a third of his kitaba is reduced, and he\nowes two-thirds.\"\n\n\nMalik spoke about a man who freed half of\nhis slave while he was ill and made irrevocable his freeing half of\nhim or all of him, and he had made another slave of his mudabbar\nbefore that. He said, \"One begins with the slave he made mudabbar\nbefore the one he freed while he was ill. That is because the man\ncannot revoke what he has made mudabbar and cannot follow it with a\nmatter which will rescind it. When this mudabbar is freed, then what\nremains of the third goes to the one who had half of him freed so as\nto complete his setting-free entirely in the third of the property of\nthe deceased.

He said, \"The master\nmust surrender what he owns of him to the injured person. He is made\nto serve the injured person and recompense (in the form of service) is\ntaken from him as the blood-money of the injury. If he completes that\nbefore his master dies, he reverts to his master.\"\n\n\nMalik\nsaid, \"The generally agreed on way of doing things in our community\nabout a mudabbar who does an injury and then his master dies and the\nmaster has no property except him is that the third (allowed to be\nbequeathed) is freed, and then the blood-money for the in jury is\ndivided into thirds. A third of the blood-money is against the third\nof him which was set free, and two-thirds are against the two-thirds\nwhich the heirs have. If they wish, they surrender what they have of\nhim to the party with the injury, and if they wish, they give the\ninjured person two-thirds of the blood-money and keep their portion of\nthe slave. That is because that injury is a criminal action by the\nslave and it is not a debt against the master by which whatever\nsetting free and tadbir the master had done would be abrogated. If\nthere were a debt to people held against the master of the slave, as\nwell as the criminal action of the slave, part of the mudabbar would\nbe sold in proportion to the blood-money of the injury and according\nto the debt. Then one would begin with the blood-money which was for\nthe criminal action of the slave and it would be paid from the price\nof the slave. Then the debt of his master would be paid, and then one\nwould look at what remained after that of the slave. His third would b\nbe set free, and two-thirds of him would belong to the heirs. That is\nbecause the criminal action of the slave is more important than the\ndebt of his master. That is because, if the man dies and leaves a\nmudabbar slave whose value is one hundred and fifty dinars, and the\nslave strikes a free man on the head with a blow that lays open the\nskull, and the blood-money is fifty dinars, and the master of the\nslave has a debt of fifty dinars, one begins with the fifty dinars\nwhich are the blood-money of the head wound, and it is paid from the\nprice of the slave. Then the debt of the master is paid. Then one\nlooks at what remains of the slave, and a third of him is set free and\ntwo-thirds of him remain for the heirs. The blood-money is more\npressing against his person than the debt of his master. The debt of\nhis master is more pressing than the tadbir which is a bequest from\nthe third of the property of the deceased. None of the tadbir is\npermitted while the master of the mudabbar has a debt which is not\npaid. It is a bequest. That is because Allah, the Blessed, the\nExalted, said, 'After any bequest that is made or any debt.' \" (Sura 4\nayat 10)\n\n\nMalik said, \"If there is enough in the third\nproperty that the deceased can bequeath to free all the mudabbar, he\nis freed and the blood-money due from his criminal action is held as a\ndebt against him which follows him after he is set free even if that\nblood-money is the full blood-money. It is not a debt on the master.\"\n\n\nMalik spoke about a mudabbar who injured a man and his master\nsurrendered him to the injured party, and then the master died and had\na debt and did not leave any property other than the mudabbar, and the\nheirs said, \"We surrender the mudabbar to the party,\" whilst the\ncreditor said, \"My debt exceeds that.\" Malik said that if the\ncreditor's debt did exceed that at all , he was more entitled to it\nand it was taken from the one who owed the debt, according to what the\ncreditor was owed in excess of the blood-money of the injury. If his\ndebt did not exceed it at all, he did not take the slave.\n\n\nMalik spoke about a mudabbar who did an injury and had property, and\nhis master refused to ransom him. He said, \"The injured party takes\nthe property of the mudabbar for the blood-money of his injury. If\nthere is enough to pay it, the injured party is paid in full for the\nblood-money of his injury and the mudabbar is returned to his master.\nIf there is not enough to pay it, he takes it from the blood-money and\nuses the mudabbar for what remains of the blood-money.\""},"hadithNumber":1613,"hadithId":7},{"id":8,"idInBook":1614,"chapterId":40,"bookId":7,"arabic":"","english":{"narrator":"","text":"Malik said in the case of an umm walad who injured someone, \"The\nblood-money of that injury is the responsibility of her master from\nhis property, unless the blood-money of the injury is greater than the\nvalue of the umm walad.
