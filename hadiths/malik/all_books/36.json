It does not\noccur in any of the hadd-punishments, nor in marriage, divorce,\nfreeing slaves, theft or slander. If some one says, 'Freeing slaves\ncomes under property,' he has erred. It is not as he said. Had it been\nas he said, a slave could take an oath with one witness, if he could\nfind one, that his master had freed him.\n\n\n\"However, when a\nslave lays claim to a piece of property, he can take an oath with one\nwitness and demand his right as the freeman demands his right.\"\n\n\nMalik said, \"The sunna with us is that when a slave brings\nsomebody who witnesses that he has been set free, his master is made\nto take an oath that he has not freed him, and the slave's claim is\ndropped.\"\n\n\nMalik said, \"The sunna about divorce is also like\nthat with us. When a woman brings somebody who witnesses that her\nhusband has divorced her, the husband is made to take an oath that he\nhas not divorced her. If he takes the oath, the divorce does not\nproceed . \"\n\n\nMalik said, \"There is only one sunna of bringing\na witness in cases of divorce and freeing a slave. The right to make\nan oath only belongs to the husband of the woman, and the master of\nthe slave. Freeing is a hadd matter, and the testimony of women is not\npermitted in it because when a slave is freed, his inviolability is\naffirmed and the hadd punishments are applied for and against him. If\nhe commits fornication and he is a muhsan, he is stoned. If he kills a\nslave, he is killed for it. Inheritance is established for him,\nbetween him and whoever inherits from him. If somebody disputes this,\narguing that if a man frees his slave and then a man comes to demand\nfrom the master of the slave payment of a debt, and a man and two\nwomen testify to his right, that establishes the right against the\nmaster of the slave so that his freeing him is cancelled if he only\nhas the slave as property, inferring by this case that the testimony\nof women is permitted in cases of setting free. The case is not as he\nsuggests (i.e. it is a case of property not freeing). It is like a man\nwho frees his slave, and then the claimant of a debt comes to the\nmaster and takes an oath with one witness, demanding his right. By\nthat, the freeing of the slave would be cancelled. Or else a man comes\nwho has frequent dealings and transactions with the master of the\nslave. He claims that he is owed money by the master of the slave.\nSomeone says to the master of the slave, 'Take an oath that you don't\nowe what he claims'. If he draws back and refuses to take an oath, the\none making the claim takes an oath and his right against the master of\nthe slave is confirmed. That would cancel the freeing of the slave if\nit is confirmed that property is owed by the master.\"\n\n\nMalik\nsaid, \"It is the same case with a man who marries a slave-girl and\nthen the master of the slave-girl comes to the man who has married her\nand claims, 'You and so-and-so have bought my slave-girl from me for\nsuch an amount of dinars. The husband of the slave-girl denies that.\nThe master of the slave-girl brings a man and two women and they\ntestify to what he has said. The sale is confirmed and his claim is\nconsidered true. So the slave-girl is haram for her husband and they\nhave to separate, even though the testimony of women is not accepted\nin divorce.\"\n\n\nMalik said, \"It is also the same case with a man\nwho accuses a free man, so the hadd falls on him. A man and two women\ncome and testify that the one accused is a slave. That would remove\nthe hadd from the accused after it had befallen him, even though the\ntestimony of women is not accepted in accusations involving hadd\npunishments.\"\n\n\nMalik said, \"Another similar case in which\njudgement appears to go against the precedent of the sunna is that two\nwomen testify that a child is born alive and so it is necessary for\nhim to inherit if a situation arises where he is entitled to inherit,\nand the child's property goes to those who inherit from him, if he\ndies, and it is not necessary that the two women witnesses should be\naccompanied by a man or an oath even though it may involve vast\nproperties of gold, silver, live-stock, gardens and slaves and other\nproperties. However, had two women testified to one dirham or more or\nless than that in a property case, their testimony would not affect\nanything and would not be permitted unless there was a witness or an\noath with them.\"\n\n\nMalik said, \"There are people who say that\nan oath is not acceptable with only one witness and they argue by the\nword of Allah the Blessed, the Exalted, and His word is the Truth,\n'And call in to witness two witnesses, men; or if the two be not men,\nthen one man and two women, such witnesses as you approve of.' (Sura 2\nayat 282). Such people argue that if he does not bring one man and two\nwomen, he has no claim and he is not allowed to take an oath with one\nwitness.\"\n\n\nMalik said, \"Part of the proof against those who\nargue this, is to reply to them, 'Do you think that if a man claimed\nproperty from a man, the one claimed from would not swear that the\nclaim was false?' If he swears, the claim against him is dropped. If\nhe refuses to take an oath, the claimant is made to take an oath that\nhis claim is true, and his right against his companion is established.\nThere is no dispute about this with any of the people nor in any\ncountry. By what does he take this? In what place in the Book of Allah\ndoes he find it? So if he confirms this, let him confirm the oath with\none witness, even if it is not in the Book of Allah, the Mighty, the\nMajestic! It is enough that this is the precedent of the sunna.\nHowever, man wants to recognise the proper course of action and the\nlocation of the proof. In this there is a clarification for what is\nobscure about that, if Allah ta'ala wills.\""},"hadithNumber":1488,"hadithId":10},{"id":11,"idInBook":1489,"chapterId":36,"bookId":7,"arabic":"","english":{"narrator":"","text":"Yahya said that Malik spoke about a man who died and had a debt\nowing to him and there was one witness, and some people had a debt\nagainst him and they had only one witness, and his heirs refused to\ntake an oath on their rights with their witness.
