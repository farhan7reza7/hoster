{"name":"65:1","price":"O Prophet, when you [believers] divorce women, divorce them with concern to their waiting period and keep an accurate count of the waiting period[1], and fear Allah, your Lord. Do not force them out of their houses, nor should they leave unless they commit a clear shameful act. Such are the limits ordained by Allah. Whoever transgresses the limits ordained by Allah has truly wronged himself. You never know, perhaps Allah will bring about a change [of heart] later[2].","arabic":"يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ إِذَا طَلَّقۡتُمُ ٱلنِّسَآءَ فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ وَأَحۡصُواْ ٱلۡعِدَّةَۖ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ رَبَّكُمۡۖ لَا تُخۡرِجُوهُنَّ مِنۢ بُيُوتِهِنَّ وَلَا يَخۡرُجۡنَ إِلَّآ أَن يَأۡتِينَ بِفَٰحِشَةٖ مُّبَيِّنَةٖۚ وَتِلۡكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِۚ وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ ٱللَّهِ فَقَدۡ ظَلَمَ نَفۡسَهُۥۚ لَا تَدۡرِي لَعَلَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحۡدِثُ بَعۡدَ ذَٰلِكَ أَمۡرٗا","category":["65 (At-Talaq)","At-Talaq","Surah At-Talaq","Chapter At-Talaq","Talaq","Surah Talaq","Chapter Talaq","At Talaq","Surah At Talaq","Chapter At Talaq","Surah 65","Chapter 65","The Divorce","الطلاق"],"ayahNumber":5218,"juzNumber":28,"footnotes":"[1] A wife should only be divorced after the completion of her monthly cycle and before sexual intercourse after purity, or else during a confirmed pregnancy.
