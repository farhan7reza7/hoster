However, flaws or mistakes could happen with prophets, like all other human beings. The examples include the Prophet’s response to the blind man (80:1-10); Jonah’s departure from his people without Allah’s permission (21:87-88); and David’s suspicion and fear of the two men who scaled the wall of his chamber (38:21-25). If the Prophet (ﷺ) himself is urged to seek Allah’s forgiveness, then the believers are far more in need of seeking Allah’s forgiveness.","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_rwwad","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.0.15","last_update":1711763763,"title":"English Translation - Rowwad Translation Center","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into Englsih by Rowwad Translation Center in cooperation with Islamhouse.com"}}
