For all of this, they said: “Who would tell our brothers about us; that we are in Paradise being provided for so that they may not give up fighting in the way of Allah or cower in war?” Allah Almighty said: “I will tell them on your behalf”. Then He revealed: “Do not think that those who were killed in the way of Allah are dead. Nay but they are alive with their Lord being provided for”.
