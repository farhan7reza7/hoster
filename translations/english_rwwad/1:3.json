Rahmān carries a wider meaning - merciful to all creation. Justice is a part of this mercy. Raheem includes the concept of specialty - especially merciful to the believers. Forgiveness is a part of this mercy. In addition, Rahmān is adjectival, referring to an attribute of Allah and is part of His essence.
