If any of your slaves wishes to enter the contract of emancipation[24], make this contract with them, if you find goodness in them, and give them some of the wealth that Allah has given you. Do not compel your slave girls into prostitution – if they wish to keep chaste – seeking the worldly gains of this life[25]. But if anyone compels them, then Allah, after such a compulsion, is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","arabic":"وَلۡيَسۡتَعۡفِفِ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يَجِدُونَ نِكَاحًا حَتَّىٰ يُغۡنِيَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضۡلِهِۦۗ وَٱلَّذِينَ يَبۡتَغُونَ ٱلۡكِتَٰبَ مِمَّا مَلَكَتۡ أَيۡمَٰنُكُمۡ فَكَاتِبُوهُمۡ إِنۡ عَلِمۡتُمۡ فِيهِمۡ خَيۡرٗاۖ وَءَاتُوهُم مِّن مَّالِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّذِيٓ ءَاتَىٰكُمۡۚ وَلَا تُكۡرِهُواْ فَتَيَٰتِكُمۡ عَلَى ٱلۡبِغَآءِ إِنۡ أَرَدۡنَ تَحَصُّنٗا لِّتَبۡتَغُواْ عَرَضَ ٱلۡحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنۡيَاۚ وَمَن يُكۡرِههُّنَّ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ مِنۢ بَعۡدِ إِكۡرَٰهِهِنَّ غَفُورٞ رَّحِيمٞ","category":["24 (An-Nur)","An-Nur","Surah An-Nur","Chapter An-Nur","Nur","Surah Nur","Chapter Nur","An Nur","Surah An Nur","Chapter An Nur","Surah 24","Chapter 24","The Light","النُّور"],"ayahNumber":2824,"juzNumber":18,"footnotes":"[24] i.e., those slaves who want to purchase their freedom for a specific price.\n [25] As happened with Abdullah ibn ’Ubayy, the head of the hypocrites, who forced his two slave-girls to commit illegal sexual acts for worldly gains, while they wished to keep chaste.","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_rwwad","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.0.15","last_update":1711763763,"title":"English Translation - Rowwad Translation Center","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into Englsih by Rowwad Translation Center in cooperation with Islamhouse.com"}}
