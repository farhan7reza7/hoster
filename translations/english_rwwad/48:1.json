This treaty was signed in 6 A.H./628 C.E. Ibn Mas‘ūd said, \"You [people] consider the conquest to be that of Makkah, but we consider it to be the Treaty of al-Hudaybiyyah.\" Al-Barā’ bin ‘Āzib said something similar to this as reported by Al-Bukhāri. Although the companions initially regarded this treaty as a setback, yet in effect, it helped promote the spread of Islam, as thousands of people from different tribes accepted Islam during that truce. This treaty was in fact a precursor to the conquest of Makkah two years later.","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_rwwad","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.0.15","last_update":1711763763,"title":"English Translation - Rowwad Translation Center","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into Englsih by Rowwad Translation Center in cooperation with Islamhouse.com"}}
