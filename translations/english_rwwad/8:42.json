Indeed, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.","arabic":"إِذۡ أَنتُم بِٱلۡعُدۡوَةِ ٱلدُّنۡيَا وَهُم بِٱلۡعُدۡوَةِ ٱلۡقُصۡوَىٰ وَٱلرَّكۡبُ أَسۡفَلَ مِنكُمۡۚ وَلَوۡ تَوَاعَدتُّمۡ لَٱخۡتَلَفۡتُمۡ فِي ٱلۡمِيعَٰدِ وَلَٰكِن لِّيَقۡضِيَ ٱللَّهُ أَمۡرٗا كَانَ مَفۡعُولٗا لِّيَهۡلِكَ مَنۡ هَلَكَ عَنۢ بَيِّنَةٖ وَيَحۡيَىٰ مَنۡ حَيَّ عَنۢ بَيِّنَةٖۗ وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَسَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ","category":["8 (Al-Anfal)","Al-Anfal","Surah Al-Anfal","Chapter Al-Anfal","Anfal","Surah Anfal","Chapter Anfal","Al Anfal","Surah Al Anfal","Chapter Al Anfal","Surah 8","Chapter 8","The Spoils of War","الأنفَال"],"ayahNumber":1202,"juzNumber":10,"footnotes":"","lang":"en"}
