So the Muslims disagreed about it; some of them said not to cut the trees, for these are gains that Allah has bestowed upon us, while some others said that we cut them off to enrage them. Hence, this verse was revealed to appease both parties of the Muslims, proclaiming that all this happened by the will of Allah. They were treated as such for their betrayal as they broke their pact with the Prophet (ﷺ).","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_rwwad","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.0.15","last_update":1711763763,"title":"English Translation - Rowwad Translation Center","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into Englsih by Rowwad Translation Center in cooperation with Islamhouse.com"}}
