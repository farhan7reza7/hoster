{"name":"4:92","price":"It is not for a believer to kill another believer except by mistake. Whoever kills a believer by mistake[67] must free a believing slave and pay blood money to his family, unless they waive it as an act of charity. But if the victim was a believer and belonged to people at war with you, then a believing slave must be freed. If he belonged to a people with whom you have a treaty, then blood money must be paid to his family and the freeing of a believing slave. Anyone who is unable must fast for two consecutive months[68] by way of repentance to Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.","arabic":"وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤۡمِنٍ أَن يَقۡتُلَ مُؤۡمِنًا إِلَّا خَطَـٔٗاۚ وَمَن قَتَلَ مُؤۡمِنًا خَطَـٔٗا فَتَحۡرِيرُ رَقَبَةٖ مُّؤۡمِنَةٖ وَدِيَةٞ مُّسَلَّمَةٌ إِلَىٰٓ أَهۡلِهِۦٓ إِلَّآ أَن يَصَّدَّقُواْۚ فَإِن كَانَ مِن قَوۡمٍ عَدُوّٖ لَّكُمۡ وَهُوَ مُؤۡمِنٞ فَتَحۡرِيرُ رَقَبَةٖ مُّؤۡمِنَةٖۖ وَإِن كَانَ مِن قَوۡمِۭ بَيۡنَكُمۡ وَبَيۡنَهُم مِّيثَٰقٞ فَدِيَةٞ مُّسَلَّمَةٌ إِلَىٰٓ أَهۡلِهِۦ وَتَحۡرِيرُ رَقَبَةٖ مُّؤۡمِنَةٖۖ فَمَن لَّمۡ يَجِدۡ فَصِيَامُ شَهۡرَيۡنِ مُتَتَابِعَيۡنِ تَوۡبَةٗ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِۗ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمٗا","category":["4 (An-Nisa)","An-Nisa","Surah An-Nisa","Chapter An-Nisa","Nisa","Surah Nisa","Chapter Nisa","An Nisa","Surah An Nisa","Chapter An Nisa","Surah 4","Chapter 4","The Women","النِّسَاء"],"ayahNumber":585,"juzNumber":5,"footnotes":"[67] Inadvertent manslaughter usually results from some degree of negligence or error, thus, this punishment is ordained for not being cautious enough.\n [68] Uninterrupted fast except when there is a valid reason, e.g., illness, menses for women etc.","lang":"en"}
