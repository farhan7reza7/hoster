{"name":"2:187","price":"It has been made permissible for you to be intimate with your wives on the nights of the fast. They are a garment for you just as you are a garment for them. Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He accepted your repentance and pardoned you. So now you may have intimacy with them[84] and seek what Allah has destined for you. And eat and drink until you see the light of dawn distinct from the darkness of night, then complete the fast until nightfall. However, should you be in a devotional retreat in the mosques then do not be intimate with them. These are the limits set by Allah, so do not even come near to them. This is how Allah makes His verses clear to people, so that they may become righteous.","arabic":"أُحِلَّ لَكُمۡ لَيۡلَةَ ٱلصِّيَامِ ٱلرَّفَثُ إِلَىٰ نِسَآئِكُمۡۚ هُنَّ لِبَاسٞ لَّكُمۡ وَأَنتُمۡ لِبَاسٞ لَّهُنَّۗ عَلِمَ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّكُمۡ كُنتُمۡ تَخۡتَانُونَ أَنفُسَكُمۡ فَتَابَ عَلَيۡكُمۡ وَعَفَا عَنكُمۡۖ فَٱلۡـَٰٔنَ بَٰشِرُوهُنَّ وَٱبۡتَغُواْ مَا كَتَبَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمۡۚ وَكُلُواْ وَٱشۡرَبُواْ حَتَّىٰ يَتَبَيَّنَ لَكُمُ ٱلۡخَيۡطُ ٱلۡأَبۡيَضُ مِنَ ٱلۡخَيۡطِ ٱلۡأَسۡوَدِ مِنَ ٱلۡفَجۡرِۖ ثُمَّ أَتِمُّواْ ٱلصِّيَامَ إِلَى ٱلَّيۡلِۚ وَلَا تُبَٰشِرُوهُنَّ وَأَنتُمۡ عَٰكِفُونَ فِي ٱلۡمَسَٰجِدِۗ تِلۡكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِ فَلَا تَقۡرَبُوهَاۗ كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ ءَايَٰتِهِۦ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمۡ يَتَّقُونَ","category":["2 (Al-Baqarah)","Al-Baqarah","Surah Al-Baqarah","Chapter Al-Baqarah","Baqarah","Surah Baqarah","Chapter Baqarah","Al Baqarah","Surah Al Baqarah","Chapter Al Baqarah","Surah 2","Chapter 2","The Cow","البَقَرَة"],"ayahNumber":194,"juzNumber":2,"footnotes":"[84] Prior to this revelation, marital relations were unlawful during nights preceding fasting.
