When the two men came to David for judgment, he ruled that the shepherd must give his sheep in compensation for the damage. Nonetheless, Solomon suggested that the sheep be kept with the owner of the tillage, so he may benefit from their milk and wool, while the shepherd should work on the land to restore it to its former state. Thus, the farmer would take back his tillage in perfect condition, and the sheep would be returned to its owner. David was impressed by his son’s insightful and fair judgment and approved it.","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_rwwad","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.0.15","last_update":1711763763,"title":"English Translation - Rowwad Translation Center","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into Englsih by Rowwad Translation Center in cooperation with Islamhouse.com"}}
