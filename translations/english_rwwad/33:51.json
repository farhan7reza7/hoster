That is more likely that they will be content and not distressed, and that they will be satisfied with what you give them all. Allah knows what is in your hearts, and Allah is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing.","arabic":"۞ تُرۡجِي مَن تَشَآءُ مِنۡهُنَّ وَتُـٔۡوِيٓ إِلَيۡكَ مَن تَشَآءُۖ وَمَنِ ٱبۡتَغَيۡتَ مِمَّنۡ عَزَلۡتَ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيۡكَۚ ذَٰلِكَ أَدۡنَىٰٓ أَن تَقَرَّ أَعۡيُنُهُنَّ وَلَا يَحۡزَنَّ وَيَرۡضَيۡنَ بِمَآ ءَاتَيۡتَهُنَّ كُلُّهُنَّۚ وَٱللَّهُ يَعۡلَمُ مَا فِي قُلُوبِكُمۡۚ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلِيمًا حَلِيمٗا","category":["33 (Al-Ahzab)","Al-Ahzab","Surah Al-Ahzab","Chapter Al-Ahzab","Ahzab","Surah Ahzab","Chapter Ahzab","Al Ahzab","Surah Al Ahzab","Chapter Al Ahzab","Surah 33","Chapter 33","The Combined Forces","الأحزَاب"],"ayahNumber":3584,"juzNumber":22,"footnotes":"[44] The Prophet’s marital life is classified into four stages: He was single until the age of 25.
