If someone declared his wife as unlawful for him as the zahr (back) of his mother is unlawful for him, his wife would be divorced. Islam abolished this divorce. Allah says: “As for those among you who divorce their wives by likening them to their mothers, they are not their mothers; their mothers are none but those who gave birth to them.” See 58:2.\n [2] Adoption of a child or an orphan is not permissible by ascribing the child to other than their real parents. Whereas, it is permissible for one to sponsor a child or host them in their home and care for them as they care for their own children, except for legal matters.","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_rwwad","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.0.15","last_update":1711763763,"title":"English Translation - Rowwad Translation Center","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into Englsih by Rowwad Translation Center in cooperation with Islamhouse.com"}}
