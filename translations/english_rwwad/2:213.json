{"name":"2:213","price":"Mankind was just one nation. Then Allah sent prophets with glad tidings and warnings[107], and sent down to them the Scriptures in truth, to judge between people in matters over which they disputed. But none disputed thereafter except out of arrogance after they had received the clear proofs[108]. Then Allah, by His grace, guided those who believed to the truth in which they disputed. For Allah guides whom He wills to a straight path.","arabic":"كَانَ ٱلنَّاسُ أُمَّةٗ وَٰحِدَةٗ فَبَعَثَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلنَّبِيِّـۧنَ مُبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ وَأَنزَلَ مَعَهُمُ ٱلۡكِتَٰبَ بِٱلۡحَقِّ لِيَحۡكُمَ بَيۡنَ ٱلنَّاسِ فِيمَا ٱخۡتَلَفُواْ فِيهِۚ وَمَا ٱخۡتَلَفَ فِيهِ إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوهُ مِنۢ بَعۡدِ مَا جَآءَتۡهُمُ ٱلۡبَيِّنَٰتُ بَغۡيَۢا بَيۡنَهُمۡۖ فَهَدَى ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لِمَا ٱخۡتَلَفُواْ فِيهِ مِنَ ٱلۡحَقِّ بِإِذۡنِهِۦۗ وَٱللَّهُ يَهۡدِي مَن يَشَآءُ إِلَىٰ صِرَٰطٖ مُّسۡتَقِيمٍ","category":["2 (Al-Baqarah)","Al-Baqarah","Surah Al-Baqarah","Chapter Al-Baqarah","Baqarah","Surah Baqarah","Chapter Baqarah","Al Baqarah","Surah Al Baqarah","Chapter Al Baqarah","Surah 2","Chapter 2","The Cow","البَقَرَة"],"ayahNumber":220,"juzNumber":2,"footnotes":"[107] Ibn ‘Abbās (رضي الله عنهما) reported: “The time between Adam and Noah was ten centuries.
