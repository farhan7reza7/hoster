{"name":"5:41","price":"O Messenger, do not grieve for those who rush to disbelief – those who say with their mouths, “We believe”, but their hearts have no faith, nor those Jews who eagerly listen to falsehood and to those who have not yet come to you[36]. They distort the words [of Allah] out of their context saying, “If you are given this [ruling] accept it[37], but if you are not given, then beware[38].” Whoever Allah wills to be misguided[39], there is nothing you can do to avail him against Allah. They are those whose hearts Allah did not will to purify. For them there is disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter they will suffer a great punishment.","arabic":"۞ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلرَّسُولُ لَا يَحۡزُنكَ ٱلَّذِينَ يُسَٰرِعُونَ فِي ٱلۡكُفۡرِ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوٓاْ ءَامَنَّا بِأَفۡوَٰهِهِمۡ وَلَمۡ تُؤۡمِن قُلُوبُهُمۡۛ وَمِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ هَادُواْۛ سَمَّٰعُونَ لِلۡكَذِبِ سَمَّٰعُونَ لِقَوۡمٍ ءَاخَرِينَ لَمۡ يَأۡتُوكَۖ يُحَرِّفُونَ ٱلۡكَلِمَ مِنۢ بَعۡدِ مَوَاضِعِهِۦۖ يَقُولُونَ إِنۡ أُوتِيتُمۡ هَٰذَا فَخُذُوهُ وَإِن لَّمۡ تُؤۡتَوۡهُ فَٱحۡذَرُواْۚ وَمَن يُرِدِ ٱللَّهُ فِتۡنَتَهُۥ فَلَن تَمۡلِكَ لَهُۥ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ شَيۡـًٔاۚ أُوْلَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَمۡ يُرِدِ ٱللَّهُ أَن يُطَهِّرَ قُلُوبَهُمۡۚ لَهُمۡ فِي ٱلدُّنۡيَا خِزۡيٞۖ وَلَهُمۡ فِي ٱلۡأٓخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٞ","category":["5 (Al-Ma'idah)","Al-Ma'idah","Surah Al-Ma'idah","Chapter Al-Ma'idah","Ma'idah","Surah Ma'idah","Chapter Ma'idah","Al Ma'idah","Surah Al Ma'idah","Chapter Al Ma'idah","Surah 5","Chapter 5","The Table Spread","المَائدة"],"ayahNumber":710,"juzNumber":6,"footnotes":"[36] They had not attended the Prophet's gatherings or heard his words.\n [37] The legal ruling desired by them.\n [38] They heed the words of warning of other conniving men who were so averse that they did not go to the Prophet (ﷺ) to hear what he had to say.\n [39] The meaning here is misbelief, misconception, or self-delusion as a result of one's own refusal of truth.","lang":"en"}
